# ATU-TheoryOfAlgorithms
This repository is a Theory Of Algorithms submission for one of my ATU university deliverables.
The purpose of this repository is to give a brief overview of the Post Correspondence Problem, as well it's bounded variant.
We also briefly touch upon the Countdown numbers game from a British television show - We'll explore solving the problem using the reverse polish notation, as well
as we'll explore the complexity and all the possibilities of such a game.

# Contents
This repository contains 2 Jupyter notebooks - You'd run those notebooks as usual, but in case you don't know how to do that, here's how;

1. Install Anaconda - You can learn more, and download Anaconda here; [Anaconda Website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)
2. Assuming you haven't already - clone this repository onto your local drive.
3. Within your local terminal of choice, navigate to the folder you've cloned the repository into
4. Finally, run jupyter-lab - This should open an interactive Jupyter Lab session in your browser, with the current folder set as the working directory, from here now on, you're free to interact with the notebook as you wish.

Optionally, after installing Anaconda (or any other Python env with Jupyter installed), your Visual Studio Code should be ready to be set-up as the renderer and editor of Jupyter Notebooks,
simply launch one of the Notebook files in VSCode and you're set.

## Run the Notebook online
In case you do not want to set-up the repository in your local environment, you can run it through the binder service - The binder service deploys and hosts
docker containers for Jupyter Notebook repositories for free, with no set-up required.

Eventually, make use of the nbViewer static renderer service to render this notebook in the browser - Make note that this is a static environment and you won't be able to
tinker with the Notebook in this way.
